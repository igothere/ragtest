# Requirements Document

## Introduction

현재 RAG 시스템에서 SentenceTransformer 모델("nlpai-lab/KURE-v1")이 api_server.py와 rag_with_tables.py 두 파일에서 각각 독립적으로 로딩되고 있습니다. 이로 인해 메모리 사용량이 증가하고 초기화 시간이 길어지는 문제가 발생하고 있습니다. 모델을 한 번만 로딩하여 공유할 수 있는 구조로 개선이 필요합니다.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the SentenceTransformer model to be loaded only once and shared across multiple processes, so that memory usage is optimized and startup time is reduced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN the SentenceTransformer model SHALL be loaded only once
2. WHEN api_server.py needs the model THEN it SHALL access the shared model instance
3. WHEN rag_with_tables.py needs the model THEN it SHALL access the same shared model instance
4. WHEN multiple processes access the model simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent access safely

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized model management system, so that model loading logic is consistent and maintainable across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new script needs the model THEN it SHALL use the centralized model manager
2. WHEN the model needs to be updated or changed THEN only one configuration point SHALL need modification
3. WHEN the system initializes THEN the model manager SHALL provide clear logging of model loading status
4. IF model loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the RAG system to have faster response times, so that document processing and query responses are more efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN the total memory footprint SHALL be reduced compared to the current implementation
2. WHEN processing multiple files simultaneously THEN the system SHALL not load duplicate model instances
3. WHEN the API server handles chat requests THEN it SHALL use the pre-loaded model without additional loading time
4. WHEN rag_with_tables.py processes documents THEN it SHALL complete faster due to shared model access

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the model sharing solution to be backwards compatible, so that existing functionality continues to work without breaking changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new model sharing system is implemented THEN all existing API endpoints SHALL continue to function
2. WHEN document processing is performed THEN the output format and quality SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN chat functionality is used THEN the response accuracy and format SHALL be maintained
4. IF the shared model system fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to individual model loading
