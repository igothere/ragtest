# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to create an advanced LLM-based chunking parser system that intelligently segments documents using Large Language Models for semantic understanding, combined with embedding generation and vector storage. The system will replace or enhance the current HLM (Hierarchical Layout Model) approach with more sophisticated AI-driven document analysis and chunking strategies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an LLM-powered document parser that can intelligently understand document structure and semantics, so that I can create more meaningful and contextually relevant chunks for RAG applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document is uploaded THEN the system SHALL use an LLM to analyze the document structure and identify logical sections
2. WHEN analyzing document structure THEN the system SHALL identify headers, paragraphs, lists, tables, and other semantic elements
3. WHEN creating chunks THEN the system SHALL preserve semantic coherence within each chunk
4. IF a section is too large THEN the system SHALL intelligently split it while maintaining context
5. WHEN processing different file formats THEN the system SHALL handle PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD, and Excel files

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the LLM chunker to generate contextually aware chunk boundaries, so that related information stays together and improves retrieval accuracy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN determining chunk boundaries THEN the system SHALL use LLM analysis to identify natural breakpoints
2. WHEN a chunk would exceed size limits THEN the system SHALL find the most appropriate split point using semantic analysis
3. WHEN creating overlapping chunks THEN the system SHALL ensure overlap contains meaningful context transitions
4. WHEN processing technical documents THEN the system SHALL keep code blocks, formulas, and diagrams with their explanatory text
5. WHEN handling multi-language content THEN the system SHALL maintain language consistency within chunks

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each chunk to include rich metadata and context information, so that I can improve search relevance and provide better source attribution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a chunk THEN the system SHALL generate a descriptive title using LLM analysis
2. WHEN processing a chunk THEN the system SHALL extract key topics and themes
3. WHEN storing chunks THEN the system SHALL include hierarchical position information
4. WHEN generating metadata THEN the system SHALL include document type, section type, and content category
5. WHEN creating embeddings THEN the system SHALL use both content and metadata for enhanced representation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to generate high-quality embeddings optimized for semantic search, so that retrieval accuracy is maximized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating embeddings THEN the system SHALL use state-of-the-art multilingual embedding models
2. WHEN processing Korean content THEN the system SHALL use Korean-optimized embedding models
3. WHEN creating embeddings THEN the system SHALL normalize and preprocess text appropriately
4. WHEN storing embeddings THEN the system SHALL use efficient vector storage with proper indexing
5. WHEN updating embeddings THEN the system SHALL support incremental updates without full reprocessing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to provide configurable chunking strategies, so that I can optimize performance for different document types and use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN the user SHALL be able to set different chunking strategies per document type
2. WHEN processing documents THEN the system SHALL support both fixed-size and semantic chunking modes
3. WHEN setting chunk parameters THEN the user SHALL be able to configure size limits, overlap ratios, and quality thresholds
4. WHEN using LLM analysis THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of different LLM models and prompts
5. WHEN processing large documents THEN the system SHALL support batch processing and progress tracking

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can monitor system performance and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages with context
2. WHEN LLM calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
3. WHEN processing documents THEN the system SHALL log progress, timing, and quality metrics
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to simpler chunking methods
5. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL track embedding quality and retrieval effectiveness
